## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow PEP 8 with these conventions:

1. **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces (no tabs)
2. **Line Length**: Maximum 88 characters (Black default)
3. **Imports**: Organize in sections (stdlib, third-party, local)
4. **Naming**: 
   - Functions/variables: `snake_case`
   - Classes: `PascalCase`
   - Constants: `UPPER_CASE`

### Code Quality

#### Use Type Hints
```python
def download_pdfs(base_url: str, output_folder: str, max_depth: int) -> None:
    """Download PDFs from a URL"""
    pass
```

#### Add Docstrings
```python
def find_pdfs(url: str, depth: int = 0, max_depth: int = 2) -> None:
    """
    Recursively find PDF links in directories.
    
    Args:
        url: Website URL to scan
        depth: Current recursion depth
        max_depth: Maximum recursion depth
    
    Returns:
        None (modifies global pdf_links list)
    """
    pass
```

#### Error Handling
```python
try:
    response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
    response.raise_for_status()
except requests.RequestException as e:
    log_callback(f"Error fetching {url}: {e}\n")
```

### Code Formatting

1. **Format Code with Black:**
```bash
black pdf_downloads.py
```

2. **Check with Flake8:**
```bash
flake8 pdf_downloads.py
```

3. **Type Check with MyPy:**
```bash
mypy pdf_downloads.py
```
